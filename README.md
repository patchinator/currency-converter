# Currency Converter

A simple currency converter built using React Native.

## Tools

* React Native
* Chakra UI/ Component Library
* Currency Converter API
* Deployed with Vercel

## Functionality

Simple functionality of fetching current data on exchange rates. 

## Learning

The idea for this small project was to familiarise myself with Chakra. The UI as a whole is
insanely easy to use (particularly thanks to extensive documentation). The project was also
intended to further familiarise myself with the React Framework; a framework I very much now
admire.
